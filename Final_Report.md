# Introduction & Business Problem

Boston and its many neighborhoods are home to a vibrant selection of bakeries and coffee shops.  Over the years, chain franchises like Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks have gained a strong foothold in the region, as well as many independent teahouses.  Such locales typically serve coffee and tea drinks, as well as light fare and baked goods and cafes.  Some identify as bakeries, others as cafes.  More recently there is an influx of coffee shops serving high-end artisan roasted coffee in a comfortable space conducive to co-working.  Given the large student body, and increasingly remote professional work force in many parts of Boston, such businesses have high potential for success if situated correctly.  I am preparing this data analysis to determine which neighborhood offers the best business opportunity for a new coffee shop,bakery, and co-working space. 

# Data

Boston and its neighborhoods will be defined by zip codes, neighborhood names, and associated latitude/longitude values.  The neighborhood and zip code data for Boston neighborhoods is obtained by scraping the HTML from a [Boston Globe website](http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/04/15/sixfigurezipcodes_city/) and constructing data tables using Beautiful.  Zip code and neighborhood data for Cambridge is obtaied through a [tool built by Randy Majors](https://www.randymajors.com/p/zipcodegmap.html) uisng the Google Maps API. The GIS data for these neighborhoods is obtained through a [repository maintained by GitHub user Eric Hurst](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/erichurst/7882666/raw/5bdc46db47d9515269ab12ed6fb2850377fd869e/US%2520Zip%2520Codes%2520from%25202013%2520Government%2520Data).  Data from the two sources is merged into one pandas dataframe containing all relevent values for 34 Boston and Cambridge neighborhoods. 

Data on existing venues in Boston/Cambridge is gathered by querying the Foursquare API, this data is divided into two sets to be analyzed.  First the so-called coffee shop adjacent venues are separated and analyzed.  These are venues in the categories containing the words 'Bakery', 'Coffee', 'Dessert', 'Pastry', 'Caf√©', 'Tea', 'Bagel', 'Donut', or 'Cupcake.'  Next, a comprehensive analysis of all venues is done.
